# statistical-arbitrage-bot

Bot Environment to Trade Statistical Arbitrage Cryptocurrencies.

Hello everyone! Once found the best coins at <a href=https://github.com/Algo-Tradings/statistical-arbitrage-research/>statistical-arbitrage-research<a> now we can use its output in this bot.
Anyway you can also use your prefered coins just editing  <a href=https://github.com/Algo-Tradings/statistical-arbitrage-bot/blob/main/settings/bot_input.csv>bot_input.csv<a>

To run the bot, you should have the lib previously installed. See...
<a href=https://github.com/Algo-Tradings/statistical-arbitrage-bot/blob/main/requirements.txt>requirements.txt<a>


After, you have to insert your api key and specify which exchange will be used at <a href=https://github.com/Algo-Tradings/statistical-arbitrage-bot/blob/main/.env>.env<a>

So finally run <a href=https://github.com/Algo-Tradings/statistical-arbitrage-bot/blob/main/app_bot.py>.appt_bot.py<a>. As long as the bot continously run, I strongly recommend using a cloud server for that.
ENJOY!
